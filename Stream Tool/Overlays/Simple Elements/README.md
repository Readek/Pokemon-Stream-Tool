# Simple Elements

This is a collection of elements from the example overlays, so that you can add them to existing scenes in your streaming software if you already have them. Like other overlays, just drag the html file into OBS.

Currently this only has an element for the party, with the aim to add others in future.


## Pokemon Party

The layout will adjust based on the width of your browser source. So 1920 width will have a single row of all 6 pokemon, 960 width will have two rows of 3, 320 width will have a vertical party, etc.
